## 🟢 Easy Problems

### 1. **Sum of Two Numbers**
**Description**:  
Ask the user to enter two integers, then print their sum.

*Example*:  
Input: `4 7`  
Output: `Sum = 11`

---

### 2. **Swap Two Numbers (Using Temp Variable)**
**Description**:  
Read two integers, swap their values using a temporary variable, and print the result.

*Example*:  
Input: `a = 5, b = 9`  
Output: `After swap: a = 9, b = 5`

---

### 3. **Find the Area of a Rectangle**
**Description**:  
Ask the user to input the rectangle’s length and width, then calculate and print the area.

Formula: `Area = length × width`

---

### 4. **Check if a Number is Even or Odd**
**Description**:  
Input an integer and check whether it’s even or odd using the modulus operator `%`.

*Hint*: A number is even if `number % 2 == 0`.

---

### 5. **Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit**
**Description**:  
Input temperature in Celsius and convert it to Fahrenheit.

Formula: `F = C × 9 / 5 + 32`

---

## 🟡 Medium Problems

### 6. **Simple Interest Calculator**
**Description**:  
Ask the user to input Principal (P), Rate (R), and Time (T).  
Then calculate and print the Simple Interest.

Formula: `SI = (P × R × T) / 100`

---

### 7. **Sum and Average of Three Numbers**
**Description**:  
Take three numbers as input, calculate their total sum and their average.

*Hint*: `Average = (a + b + c) / 3.0`

---

### 8. **Last Digit of a Number**
**Description**:  
Input an integer and display its last digit.  
Use `% 10` to isolate the last digit.

*Example*:  
Input: `257` → Output: `7`

---

### 9. **Calculate Square and Cube of a Number**
**Description**:  
Ask the user for a number and display its square and cube.

*Example*:  
Input: `3` → Output: `Square = 9, Cube = 27`

---

### 10. **Sum of Digits of a Two-Digit Number**
**Description**:  
Input a two-digit number and find the sum of its digits.

*Hint*: Use `/ 10` to get the first digit, `% 10` for the second digit.

*Example*:  
Input: `43` → Output: `7`

---

## 🔴 Hard Problems

### 11. **Reverse a 3-digit Number**
**Description**:  
Read a 3-digit number and reverse its digits.

*Example*:  
Input: `321` → Output: `123`

*Hint*: Extract digits using `%` and `/`, then combine in reverse.

---

### 12. **Check if Two Numbers are Equal Without `==`**
**Description**:  
Ask the user to input two numbers. Compare them without using `==`.

*Hint*: Use subtraction, logical operators, or bitwise logic.

---

### 13. **Convert Days into Years, Weeks, and Days**
**Description**:  
Input the total number of days and convert it into years, weeks, and remaining days.

Assume:  
- 1 year = 365 days  
- 1 week = 7 days

---

### 14. **Calculate BMI**
**Description**:  
Ask the user for weight (kg) and height (m), then calculate and display BMI.

Formula: `BMI = weight / (height * height)`

---

### 15. **Multiply Without Using Multiplication Operator**
**Description**:  
Input two positive integers and calculate their product using only addition (e.g., a loop).

*Hint*: Repeat addition `b` times: `sum = sum + a`.

---

## ✅ What's Next?

When you finish Day 00, you’ll have a solid grasp of:
